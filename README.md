# Welcome to this test

You can read this for 2 reasons : you applied for a tech job at D-Rating, or you found this project on GitHub ...

Before we read résumés, we prefer reading your source code. Please execute the TODO list and send your source code to mederic.salles@ <domain name of d-rating>. In your Email, tell us how long it took to do that, what you like and dislike in computer sciences.

Keep in mind : Everything is a test, the way you code, the way you send your source code ...
